# ScienceAlert Updated

This is a minor updated version of the Kerbal Space Program mod ScienceAlert (see original here: https://github.com/DennyTX/ScienceAlert) to fix a few bugs.

Significant FPS drop


I just got this, and started a new game.  When I go on EVA and get an EVA report, then hit keep, it doesnt show it for review on my kerbal or when I get back to my capsule.  Transmitting data does not seem to work even when having an external antenna.
