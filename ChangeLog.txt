1.9.4.1
	Following from 4x4cheesecake:
		Science Alert now works along Kerbalism
		Stored experiments are detected in all loaded vessels
	Removed unnecessary line from AssemblyVersion.tt:  <#@ assembly name="EnvDTE" #>

1.9.4
	Thanks to github & forum user @jefftimlin for this fix:
		The BiomeFilter class  attempted to generate a clean biome texture for the purposes of more accurate biome detection, 
		however it's expensive and complicated. Completely removed all of the complex code from this class to avoid the threading
		issue entirely, and just made it use the ScienceUtil.GetExperimentBiome function, which seems to work well. 
		It makes the code faster, simpler, and safer.
		Fixed an array index out of bounds problem in RequiresCrew.cs, which I found while debugging, which would intermittently 
		produce errors in the logs.
